This is part of Odin Project Curriculum

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

The design is taken from another student's design. Please see at https://michalosman.github.io/todo-list/

The things that I learnt here are:

1. How to configure webpack and use modules to separate different functionalities from each other.
2. Learning further on DOM manipulation
3. Using local storage to mimic a "database"
